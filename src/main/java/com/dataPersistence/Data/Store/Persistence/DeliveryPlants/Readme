Delivering Plants
Our flower store is expanding!
We now want to be able to deliver bushes in addition to flowers,
so we need to update our program to support both shrubbery and flowers.

Create a new parent class called Plant that contains the shared attributes of name,
price, and id. TurnFlower into a subclass of Plant that just has the attribute color.
Create a new class called Shrub and add attributes for height and width.
We want to keep using our table ‘plant’ to store all the shared data,
but our flowers and shrubs should have separate tables for their unique fields,
so make any changes necessary for this to happen.

We also want to update our Delivery class so that it is associated with our plants.
Modify Delivery so that it includes a list of all the Flowers and Shrubs to be included in the delivery.
Make this association bidirectional, and store the association in the ‘plant’ table in a column called ‘delivery_id’.
Make sure to add and update any relevant getter and setter methods.

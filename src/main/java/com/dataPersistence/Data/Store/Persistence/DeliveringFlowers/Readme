You're creating a flower-delivery service.
Create two new Java classes representing the following Entities:
1. A Flower for your company to sell.
2. A Delivery you will make.

The Flower should have a name, color, and price attribute.
Flowers will be stored in a table called 'plant'.
Make sure the price is stored as a DECIMAL column with 12 precision and 4 decimal places (scale).

The Delivery should have a recipient name, address, delivery date, and delivery time.
Let's store the whole address in a single field, so make sure the column will be wide enough to hold up to 500 characters.
We'll call this column address_full.
There should also be an attribute on the Delivery entity that shows if it is completed or not,
which should show up as 'Y' or 'N' in the database.
Make sure that both the flower name and recipient name will support international language characters
and that the delivery time is stored without timezone information.
Finally, make sure to add getters and setters to your classes.
We won't explicitly cover getter and setter methods as they're part of the prerequisite knowledge required for this course,
but they're still a very important, and required, part of many Java classes!
